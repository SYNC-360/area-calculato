```

**Alternative: Custom Event Tracking (Recommended)**
```javascript
// Track clicks on Lab101 link
document.querySelector('a[href="https://lab101.com"]')
  .addEventListener('click', () => {
    gtag('event', 'click_lab101_hub', {
      'event_category': 'backlink',
      'event_label': 'navigation_grid',

## Performance Benchmarks

### CTR Targets
```
Lab101:             8-10%  (HIGH - Featured)
Circumference:      5-7%   (MEDIUM-HIGH)
Radius:             4-6%   (MEDIUM)
Diameter:           3-5%   (MEDIUM)
Formulas:           3-4%   (MEDIUM-LOW)
Applications:       2-3%   (LOW)

```

### Traffic Distribution Targets
```
Lab101 Referrals:   20-25% of total network traffic
Circumference:      15-20% of internal traffic
Radius:             10-15% of internal traffic
Diameter:           8-12%  of internal traffic
Others:             40-50% across remaining links
```
